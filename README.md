## Real-Time Exercise Rep Counter with Pose Estimation :

### Overview

This project implements a real-time exercise repetition counter using MediaPipe Pose estimation for a variety of exercises, including biceps curls, squats, shoulder lateral raises, and front lateral raises. It utilizes a Python script and the OpenCV library to process video frames, extract pose landmarks, and track exercise movements to count repetitions accurately.

### Features:

Real-time exercise repetition counting for biceps curls, squats, shoulder lateral raises, and front lateral raises
Utilizes MediaPipe Pose estimation for accurate pose detection and landmark extraction
Customizable counter display for visualizing exercise progress
Option to save processed video with exercise counter overlay
